## Mental Models and Narrative Structures in Charles Dickens' Novels

This repository aims to identify and analyse recurring cognitive patterns in the narrative structures and character arcs of Charles Dickensâ€™ novels, using frameworks from cognitive science, such as the theory of mind, mental schemas, narrative comprehension, and identity construction.

### ðŸ§  Coding Goals
#### - Detect Cognitive Verbs / Mental State Terms
Automate detection of Theory of Mind (ToM) instances in Dickens' texts.

#### - Analyze Narrative Perspective Shifts
Track which characters are being "mentalised" and when.

### ðŸ§° Libraries & Tools Youâ€™ll Use
spaCy (NLP pipeline for sentence and token analysis)

NLTK or TextBlob (for sentiment or lexical stats)

matplotlib / seaborn (for visualizing trends)

pandas (for structured analysis)

transformers (for BERT-based emotion/sentiment detection (later?))

### ðŸ¤¯ Ideas
Compare the emotional arc of a narrator vs other characters.
